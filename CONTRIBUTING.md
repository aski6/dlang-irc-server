# Contributing
Contributions to the development of this IRC server are welcome. A guide on how best to contribute, and the requirements of doing so follows.

## Bugs
Please report any bugs/problems in the server using the issues for the github repository <https://github.com/aski6/irc-server-dlang/issues>.
When posting an issue, please provide a detailed description of the problem and the steps to cause it. Include any server and client logs/output, your system information (OS, compiler, version of dub and compiler) and the version of the server affected (release or branch and commit).

## Code
### Making Changes
To contribute code with added features or fixed bugs, please fork the repository on github, and make your changes/additions in a branch named according to this format: `username-[add/fix]-[component]`. For example, if I were to fix a problem with nickname assignment, I would name my branch `aski6-fix-nicknameassign`.
### Licensing
The licence under which irc-server-dlang is distributed under can be read in the file LICENCE, located in the root directory of the repository.
### Copyright
To submit code to the main repository for irc-server-dlang, you are required to submit your copyright on your submitted code to the holder of the github account aski6. This allows any required changes to the project licensing to be made without having to maintain contact to each copyright holder, and also means that only the primary author/maintainer aski6 is required to represent the entire copyright of the project.
To submit your copyright, add a line to the CONTRIBUTORS file reading `I, [optional realname, if used follow with a comma] the holder of the github account [github username, this is required], assign copyright from my contribution to irc-server-dlang to the holder of the aski6 github account`. If you, like aski6, elect to not use your real identity, you acknowledge that your github account is the only way to identify you and your contribution, meaning that all copyright submissions without a real identity will be treated as the legal submission of the account holder and that the github account will be used to identify you as a contributor.
### Submitting Changes
To submit a change to the main repository, create a pull request for your branch and describe what you have done. The changes you have made will be reviewed here, and changes can be requested for your code if it would cause problems to merge it into the repository in it's current state. When submitting changes, ensure to have followed all of the steps above to assign/transfer your copyright on your submitted code
